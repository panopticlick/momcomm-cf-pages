# MomComm — The Mom Economy OS

MomComm powers a modern headless content stack for gear reviews, software workflows, and venture playbooks.

## Quick start

This template can be deployed directly from our Cloud hosting and it will set up the database and cloud object storage for media.

## Quick Start - local setup

To spin up this template locally, follow these steps:

### Clone

After you click the `Deploy` button above, you'll want to have standalone copy of this repo on your machine. If you've already cloned this repo, skip to [Development](#development).

### Development

1. First [clone the repo](#clone) if you have not done so already
2. Start the services (PostgreSQL & Redis), if you have not done so already:

   ```bash
   # Create the network if it doesn't exist
   docker network create payloadcms_momcomm

   # Start services
   cd .docker/services
   cp .env.example .env
   docker compose up -d
   cd ../..
   ```

3. `cp .env.example .env` to copy the example environment variables.
4. `pnpm install && pnpm dev` to install dependencies and start the dev server
5. open `http://localhost:3000` to open the app in your browser

That's it! Changes made in `./src` will be reflected in your app. Follow the on-screen instructions to login and create your first admin user.

### Docker Deployment

For production deployment using Docker, please refer to [.docker/README.md](.docker/README.md).

## How it works

The Payload config is tailored specifically to the needs of most websites. It is pre-configured in the following ways:

### Collections

See the [Collections](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/collections) docs for details on how to extend this functionality.

- #### Users (Authentication)

  Users are auth-enabled collections that have access to the admin panel.

  For additional help, see the official [Auth Example](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/examples/auth) or the [Authentication](https://payloadcms.com/docs/authentication/overview#authentication-overview) docs.

- #### Media

  This is the uploads enabled collection. It features pre-configured sizes, focal point and manual resizing to help you manage your pictures.
